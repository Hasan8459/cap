    <h1>Automobile Inheritance Model</h1>

    <!-- <p>Problem Statement :-
        You have been appointed as senior developer in Tata’s R&D department. The engineers there are lazy, they don’t want to do everything from scratch whenever they create a new model. They expect you to help them create an inheritance model for the automobiles.
        
        Description :-
        Implement an inheritance model for four wheeler automobiles.
        Implement using both object.create() and constructor functions().
        Think of properties of what can be inherited.</p> -->
