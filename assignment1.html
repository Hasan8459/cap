    <h1>constructor function</h1>
</body>
<!-- Create constructor functions for Book and Author to represent books and authors.
The Author constructor should take name, birthYear, and nationality as arguments.
The Book constructor should take title, author (an Author object), genre, and price as arguments.
Implement methods in the Book prototype:
getBookInfo - to print the book's title, author's name, genre, and price.
Create an online bookstore by creating instances of Book and Author objects.
Display the book details for each book in the bookstore.
Submit your GitHub link after completing the problem. -->
